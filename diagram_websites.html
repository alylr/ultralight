                I selected the <a href="https://theuselessweb.com/">"Useless Web"</a> link as my website. 
                This website was in the "fun" section of the diagram. 
            </p>

                This website takes you to other random websites that contain "useless" content. 
                Some examples of the websites that it takes you to are:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://puginarug.com/">Pug In A Rug</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://sliding.toys/mystic-square/8-puzzle/daily/">Sliding Toys Puzzles</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://clicking.toys/flip-grid/neat-nine/3-holes/">Clicking Toys Puzzles</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://optical.toys/">Optical Illusions</a></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                I thought this website was interesting, because it shows the different types of fun and creative websites that can be created. 
                The main website highlights how websites can be used to link to other websites. 
            </p>
