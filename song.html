<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<h2>Verse 1</h2>
<p>
    <br>We took a u-turn down on 42nd street
    <br>Almost hit another car
    <br>Spilled my coffee on my jeans and I said
    <br>"Aw, they're ruined now"
    <br>She said
    <br>"Naw, they're better now. It's just a matter of perspective."
    <br>She kissed my cheek
    <br>"Its the little imperfections that make 'em unique."
    <br>I don't know how she does it, but she could
</p>

<h2>Chorus</h2>
<p>
    <br>See the stars in the city
    <br>She sees a diamond when the world sees dust
    <br>Finds the glitter in the gritty
    <br>I know I ain't much but
    <br>That girl sees something nobody else can see
    <br>Maybe she sees something in me
    <br>If she could see the stars in the city
</p>

<h2>Verse 2</h2>
<p>
    <br>The more I hang with her the more I realize
    <br>There can be beauty in the broken if you open up your mind
    <br>She says thinks like
    <br>"Ain't this rain nice" and
    <br>"Don't sad songs make you smile"
    <br>Well if she's crazy
    <br>I wanna be crazy too
    <br>She's the kinda girl that can break up a band
    <br>I wanna see the way that she can
</p>

<h2>Chorus</h2>
<p>
    <br>See the stars in the city
    <br>She sees a diamond when the world sees dust
    <br>Finds the glitter in the gritty
    <br>I know I ain't much but
    <br>That girl sees something nobody else can see
    <br>Maybe she sees something in me
    <br>If she could see the stars in the city
</p>
<p>
    <br>That girl sees something nobody else can see
    <br>Maybe she sees something in me
    <br>If she could see the stars in the city
    <br>In the city
</p>

<h2>Chorus</h2>
<p>
    <br>See the stars in the city
    <br>The stars in the city
    <br>She sees a diamond when the world sees dust
    <br>Finds the glitter in the gritty
    <br>So pretty she can break your heart
    <br>Yeah she sees the stars in the city
</p>

<h2>Outro</h2>
<p>
    <br>In the city
    <br>She sees the stars in the city
    <br>Yeah
