            <h3>Thank you for visiting this website!</h3>
            <p>
                This is a website that I built for my final project for my VIS208: Graphic Design Link course (Spring 2024).
                For the course, we built websites that are <i>ultralight</i>, and one of the goals of this assignment was to create a very lightweight, simple website.
                We each designed and built a website for a specific location on campus, 
                and our websites all change based on the time of day.
            </p>
            <p>
                More information about the course can be found <a href="https://veryinteractive.net/ultralight/">here on our class site</a>.

            <h3>Website Goals:</h3>        
            <p>
                The primary goal of this website is to provide an overview of the many options of things to do in Princeton, both on the University's campus and in the town and areas around campus, and to 
                share some specific ideas of things to do and see while in Princeton.
            </p>

            <h3>Design Inspiration:</h3>
            <p>
                This design is inspired by the intersecting paths in front of Nassau Hall which all lead to different parts of campus and town.
                The homepage design represents these intersecting paths, as well as resembling a compass which can guide you to different areas in Princeton.
            </p>
            <p>
                The design also is similar to an analog clock. Suggestions for things to do are are available based on the time of day. If you visit the website again at a different 
                time of day, a different set of icons will be available with activities and suggestions relevant to that time of day. The time changing nature of the website also 
                provides a representation of "a day in the life" at Princeton, by highlighting the places that are particularly popular throughout the day.
            </p>
